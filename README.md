# TalChorus

TalChorus is the chorus part of [TAL-NoiseMaker](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-noisemaker) extracted as a standalone VST plugin. This makes it similar to [TAL-Chorus-LX](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-chorus-lx) but this is not available for Linux, to I extracted the chorus from the open source NoiseMaker instead.

## Status

- Still working on getting DPF up and running.

## Compiling

This is how:

    git submodule update
    make init
